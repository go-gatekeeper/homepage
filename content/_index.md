# gatekeeper

gatekeeper is the simple authentication and authorization proxy that gets your app off the ground!

> gatekeeper was previously known as louketo and keycloak-gatekeeper.

## Goals

+ To have just enough auth features (both authentication and authorization) to get your app off the ground
+ To be well documented and easy to get started with
+ To remain true to the roots of this project
  + gatekeeper will be interoperable with keycloak out of the box,
  + but not be limited to work only with keycloak
